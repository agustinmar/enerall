    <p>In 1994 we initiated the selection of various crops with the objective of identifying different species that had potential as biofuel feedstock.</p>
    <p>In 2007 an aggressive project regarding genetic improvement, research and development of sweet sorghum and castor was consolidated due to its high potential to meet strategic objectives of the company.</p>
    <p>In 2008 Enerall established research centers in the states of Sonora, Yucatan, Veracruz, and Nayarit in order to continuously improve its soil transformation technology and keep moving forward with the cropsâ€™ genetic developments, as well as identifying the best timeframes according to local weather conditions.</p>
    <p>In 2011 the transformation of 1,750 hectares in Tizimin, Yucatan was initiated, on degraded land previously occupied for cattle raising and extensive agriculture.</p>
    <p>In 2013 Enerall starts with castor oil production, vertically integrating along the castor crop value chain.</p>
